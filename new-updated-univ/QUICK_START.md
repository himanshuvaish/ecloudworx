# QUICK START - eCloudWorx University Internet Deployment

## What This Package Contains

This is a complete solution to securely expose your eCloudWorx University frontend to the internet while keeping your Strapi backend protected.

## The Problem You Had
- Frontend exposed to internet tries to call localhost:7200
- localhost:7200 refers to user's machine, not your server
- API calls fail because users don't have Strapi running

## Our Solution
- Nginx reverse proxy serves both frontend and API
- Only port 80 exposed to internet  
- Strapi remains internal and secure
- No CORS issues (same origin)

## Installation Steps

1. **Extract this package** to your eCloudWorx University project directory

2. **Make the deployment script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Run the automated deployment:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Access your application:**
   - Website: http://your-server-ip/
   - API: http://your-server-ip/api/articles  
   - Admin: http://your-server-ip/admin

## What the Script Does

âœ… Backs up your original files  
âœ… Updates React code to use relative URLs  
âœ… Creates production environment file  
âœ… Sets up nginx reverse proxy  
âœ… Configures Docker containers  
âœ… Tests the deployment  
âœ… Provides management commands
